# SNHU_CS300_Project_Two

In this project for Data Structures and Algorithms class I was tasked with implementing an algorithm to to alphanumerically 
sort and print a list of course information for a Course Planner app for ABCU.
I chose to implement a Binary Search Tree because it made sorting very fast and easy.
All functionality it present and the menus are adequately formatted.
If i spent more time on the project I would have liked to utilize _getch() and system('CLS') to make it soe the menu was fixed
at the top of the window but for the purposes of this assignment, I believe I have met all requirements.
Further, this project would have benefitted from break classes such as the Course structures and the Binary Search Tree into 
seperate files with corresponding header files to make it more modular and easy to read but i was pressed for time.
